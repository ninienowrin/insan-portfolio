  bio: [
    "I'm a 2nd year PhD student at UCF's Department of Civil, Environmental and Construction Engineering, working with Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Aty. I work with sensors and computer vision to understand how sensor fusion can give us a comprehensive understanding of traffic scenarios — and I'm trying to push the boundaries of what that means for improving transportation systems.",
    "Right now, I lead research on two FDOT-funded projects: a radar-camera sensor fusion pipeline for 3D object detection in real-world traffic, and a digital twin framework for smart intersection deployment. My work spans from low-level radar signal processing and Doppler analysis to high-level BEV (bird's-eye-view) fusion architectures.",
    "Before my PhD, I earned a B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the Islamic University of Technology, where I built IoT-based road safety monitoring systems and worked as an embedded systems engineer. That cross-disciplinary foundation — bridging hardware, signal processing, and AI — shapes how I approach every transportation problem.",
