  bio: [
    "I'm a PhD researcher at UCF working under Dr. Mohamed Abdel-Aty, focused on one question: how do we make infrastructure truly understand the traffic around it? My research sits at the intersection of radar perception, computer vision, and sensor fusion — building systems that detect, track, and interpret vehicles in real-world conditions where cameras alone fall short.",
    "I currently lead two FDOT-funded projects. The first develops a radar-camera fusion pipeline for bird's-eye-view vehicle detection — from raw Doppler processing to deep learning architectures that work at actual intersections. The second builds a digital twin framework for smart intersection deployment, bridging simulation with real sensor data. Both are designed to be deployed, not just published.",
    "Before UCF, I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from IUT, built IoT road safety monitoring systems at BUET's Accident Research Institute, and spent three years as an embedded systems engineer. That path — from soldering circuits to training neural networks — is why I think about transportation problems differently.",
